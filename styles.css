/* The System Font Stack

    1. If the font-family is set to something that is not installed on the user's computer, then a fallback font will be displayed.
    2. If no fallback is defined, then the default HTML font is used which does not look good
    3. It is common to see long stacks of fonts to ensure atleast one of them is downloaded

    Example:

    body {
        font-family: system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
    }


*/

/* Web Fonts

    1. To use a font that will not be available on the user's device, you need to import the font from an online source such as a font library or asset
    2. Importing fonts allows them to be used with the font-fmaily css property
    3. It is important to add a fallback font to ensure the site will not look broken if the url or external api changes or goes down at some point

*/

/* Online Font Libraries

    1. One way to get fonts not instlaled on user devices is through an online font library
    2. The library will provide a code snippet that must be placed either in the head of the HTML or the top of a CSS file

    Example: 

    === link tags to be put in the head tags of HTML ===
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

    == import tag that is placed at the top of a CSS file ===
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap');


*/

/* Self Hosted Fonts

    1. Fonts can be downloaded from the web, and then defined in the CSS file with the @font-face rule
    2. There are a variety of font file formats but not all are supported by all browsers
    3. This methods can be more reliable than relying on third-party fonts but a fallback should still be included

    Example:

    @font-face {
        font-family: my-cool-font;
        src: url(../fonts/the-font-file.woff);
    }

    h1 {
        font-family: my-cool-font, sans-serif;
    }
